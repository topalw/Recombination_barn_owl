# synteny plot 

For the synteny we use the pipeline in [this publication](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2112494118?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed). Briefly all scaffolds were compared to chicken chromosomes. Pairwise alignments were made using lastz. Comparison of the two super-scaffold 2 linkage groups (LG1 and LG24) were performed separately and joing together during plotting in chrgraph.R.
